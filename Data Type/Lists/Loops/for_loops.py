# for loops is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string)
# and execute a block of code multiple times.
# Example: Iterating over a list of fruits
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"This is a/an {fruit.title()}.")  # Output: This is an Apple. This is a Banana. This is a Cherry.
    print(f"You really like {fruit.title()}!\n")  # Output: You really like Apple! etc.

print("These are my favourit fruits",fruits)
